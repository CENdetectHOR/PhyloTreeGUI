Suggestions: it is highly recommended to use a virtual environment. Here below a guide to the creation
of a new environment with conda

https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

The code has been successfully tested on Python 3.9.x. In the future, compatibility with newer/older
Python versions will be ensured.

In order to make the PhyloTreeGUIv1.0 tool work, you need to install some packages:

tkinter version 8.6
matplotlib version 3.8.x
numpy

To launch the GUI, open an Ubuntu terminal and type the command:

python main.py

If you want to launch the GUI at full screen (i.e., the GUI size matches the screen size), you can type the command:

python main.py --fullscreen

In both cases, to exit the GUI you may simply press the "ESC" keyboard button.
