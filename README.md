# PhyloTreeGUI

A tool for visualizing interactive phylogenetic trees. The tool works as follows:

1) you can select the phyloXML file to be loaded, which contains two trees: monomers and HORs;
2) you can see the HORs' tree;
3) you can click on the HORs and display the associated monomers' tree, the monomers belonging to each HOR and the locations of the HORs in the chromosome sequence.

Additional features involve the possibility to zoom on the monomers' tree to see the collapsed branches, to change the list of HORs to be visualized, etc.
